# COVID-19 Outbreak Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the outbreak of COVID-19 using a linear regression model. The goal is to gain insights into the spread of the pandemic and anticipate its impact.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid19-outbreak-prediction.git

2. Install the required dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Data

The dataset used in this project is sourced from reputable COVID-19 databases. It contains information about daily cases, deaths, and recoveries, as well as other relevant factors such as population, healthcare capacity, and mobility.

## Preprocessing

The data preprocessing step involves handling missing values, removing outliers, and performing feature engineering. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is also conducted to gain insights into the dataset and identify any patterns or correlations.

## Modeling

Linear regression is employed to build the prediction model. The features selected for the model include demographic data, healthcare capacity, and various pandemic-related factors. Model training and evaluation are carried out to assess the performance and accuracy of the predictions.

## Results
The results of the COVID-19 outbreak predictions are presented visually through informative charts and graphs. Evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) is provided to assess the model's effectiveness.
